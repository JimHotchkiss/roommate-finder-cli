* Started by mkdir 'config', and created an 'environment' file
* Then created a 'Gemfile' by running 'bundle init'
* Now populate Gemfile
* Make another mkdir 'lib'
* Where I will have my classes: room.rb and room_scraper.rb
* Now, I want to make a Rakefile (for a console?)
* Now, setup 'environment'
* Be sure to install 'bundle' ~ 'bundle' in terminal.

## At this point, everything is working, I can start writing code ##
